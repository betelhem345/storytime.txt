Once upon a time, there was a man named Justin. 
Justin has been going through a break up and resulted to online dating except he was too broke to afford Tinder plus.
While scrolling through craiglist dating ads,
He found someone who he was interested in as the person was a PhD student at Clown University. 
Justin started directly messaging the PhD student who's name was Charlie. 
Charlie had 8 Identical brothers, 23 chickens, and a giant garden gnome collection.
